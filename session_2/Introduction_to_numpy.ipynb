    "# 3.0 Introduction to Numpy \n",
    "\n",
    "Numpy is a very important Python package and is used for many applications in science. Numpy offers mathematical functions, linear algebra and much more. Most usefully, it is a package to do vectorized array programming. It is probably one of the most widely used packages in python and underpins other important libraries such as Pandas (data science) matplotlib (plotting) and scikit-image (image processing).\n",
    "\n",
    "We will do a whistle stop tour of Numpy today to show you some concepts of array programming. It is worth delving into this pacakge a bit more to understand what is gonig on. You can find the documentation for Numpy at https://numpy.org/doc/stable/user/absolute_beginners.html\n",

    "During the course you will have seen the `import` statement at the top of some cells and may wonder what this is doing. Remember namespaces from earlier in the course? All the `import` statement is doing is bringing packages into the global namespace. You will often see the import of Numpy written as it is is in the cell below , we abbreviate `numpy` to `np` so we have less to type. We can access objects from the numpy package using the `.` notation. In the cell below we are importing Numpy and accessing the value of `pi` using the `.` notation. \n",
