You will learn in this session some of the fundamentals of writing code, which you may never have to use again, but will hopefully help you with your coding journey."

    "* integer: `1, 2, 3`\n",
    "* doubles and floats (the difference between these is outside the scope of this course): `1.0,  3.14 ,100020343.432`\n",
