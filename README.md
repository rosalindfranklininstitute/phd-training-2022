# phd-training-2022

This repo is a selection of worked examples used in our PhD training.

## Session 1 - Biology with python

Biological examples of Python programming, to showcase some example use cases for
programming and Python in particular.

 *  Stats and plotting using an example from enzyme kinetics

 *  Modelling a zombie apocalypse using ordinary differential equations (ODEs)

 *  Simulating Michaelis-Menten (catalytic conversion) reactions using [PySB](https://pysb.org)

## Session 2 - Basic Programming

An introduction to the basics of programming in Python, such as importing packages,
variables, loops and functions.

## Session 3 - Programming in the Franklin Universe

## Try using Binder

You can try out these examples in a free online environment called [Binder](https://mybinder.org)
using the link below. You'll get a [Jupyter Lab](https://jupyter.org) interface in your browser.

[![Launch Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/rosalindfranklininstitute/phd-training-2022/HEAD)

Note that Binder instances are ephemeral - changes are discarded at the end of your session. You
can save your work by downloading notebooks to your local computer if desired.

## Tutorial list

1. [Learn Git Branching](https://learngitbranching.js.org/)
   - An interactive tutorial in the web browser for learning how to use Git version control software.

## Reading list

Free to download as `.pdf` files. Incredibly important resources for understanding theory and domain of computational modelling. 

Foundation in core techniques and fundamental mathematics for machine learning. Start here:
1. [The Hundred-Page Machine Learning Book - Burkov](http://themlbook.com/wiki/doku.php)
   - Short and sweet. It gives you a foot in the door with the names and brief overviews of many useful data models.
2. [Introduction to Applied Linear Algebra: Vectors, Matrices, and Least Squares - Boyd and Vandenberghe](http://vmls-book.stanford.edu/)
   - Provides a strong background in taking your linear algebra knowledge and expending it to higher dimensional problems.

More advanced books by leading researchers, offering a deeper look at the theory of machine learning:
3. [Deep Learning - Goodfellow](https://github.com/janishar/mit-deep-learning-book-pdf)
   - Builds on "Introduction to Applied Linear Algebra" and applies it to models such as MLP and CNN.
4. [Machine Learning - Bishop](http://users.isr.ist.utl.pt/~wurmd/Livros/school/Bishop%20-%20Pattern%20Recognition%20And%20Machine%20Learning%20-%20Springer%20%202006.pdf)
   - A more in depth book on image processing methods.
5. [The Elements of Statistical Learning - Hastie](https://web.stanford.edu/~hastie/Papers/ESLII.pdf)
   - An advanced book on Statistical Modelling with many worked examples.

Other interesting topics to learn about:

6. [Bayesian Methods for Hackers](http://camdavidsonpilon.github.io/Probabilistic-Programming-and-Bayesian-Methods-for-Hackers/)
   - A book not about "hacking"! Rather, a book about applying Bayesian statistical modelling to your data.
