# phd-training-2022
This repo is a selection of worked example used in our PhD training 

## Session 1 - Biology with python. 

 *  Stats and plotting.

 *  Learning about ODE's with Zombie apocalypes exmaple:
https://github.com/LoLab-VU/zombie-apocalypse

 * Mob programming on creating our own ODE example 

## Session 2 - Basic Programming



## Secion 3 - Programming in the Franklin Universe

## Reading list

Free to download as `.pdf` files. Incredibly important resources for understanding theory and domain of computational modelling. 

Foundation in core techniques and fundamental mathematics for machine learning. Start here:
1. [The Hundred-Page Machine Learning Book - Burkov](http://themlbook.com/wiki/doku.php)
   - Short and sweet. It gives you a foot in the door with the names and brief overviews of many useful data models.
2. [Introduction to Applied Linear Algebra: Vectors, Matrices, and Least Squares - Boyd and Vandenberghe](http://vmls-book.stanford.edu/)
   - Provides a strong background in taking your linear algebra knowledge and expending it to higher dimensional problems.

More advanced books by leading researchers, offering a deeper look at the theory of machine learning:
3. [Deep Learning - Goodfellow](https://github.com/janishar/mit-deep-learning-book-pdf)
   - Builds on "Introduction to Applied Linear Algebra" and applies it to models such as MLP and CNN.
4. [Machine Learning - Bishop](http://users.isr.ist.utl.pt/~wurmd/Livros/school/Bishop%20-%20Pattern%20Recognition%20And%20Machine%20Learning%20-%20Springer%20%202006.pdf)
   - A more in depth book on image processing methods.
5. [The Elements of Statistical Learning - Hastie](https://web.stanford.edu/~hastie/Papers/ESLII.pdf)
   - An advanced book on Statistical Modelling with many worked examples.

Other interesting topics to learn about:

6. [Bayesian Methods for Hackers](http://camdavidsonpilon.github.io/Probabilistic-Programming-and-Bayesian-Methods-for-Hackers/)
   - A book not about "hacking"! Rather, a book about applying Bayesian statistical modelling to your data.
